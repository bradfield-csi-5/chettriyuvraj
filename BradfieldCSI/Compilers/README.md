# Compilers


- Prework 2 (scanning) and Prework 3 (parsing) implemented [here](https://github.com/chettriyuvraj/lox-crafting-interpreters) (it is basically porting Lox to Go)
- Prework 4 - implementing new CPython keyword is implemented [as a commit in my personal cpython fork](https://github.com/chettriyuvraj/cpython/commit/6b3b291d5332b44546737e6443a020c4f81a367c)
