# Notes

- While reading up on the fetch-decode-execute cycle, realized the depth of the topic (exercise is quite a high-level intro)
- Forgot there was an exercise file to be downloaded so self-implemented a vm (contained in selfvm folder)
- Later downloaded the exercise file and solved it using much of the same ideas.
- Enjoyable!
