/* Exercise 7.14: Define a new concrete type that satisfies the Expr interface and provides a new 
operation such as computing the minimum value of its operands. Since the Parse function does 
not create instances of this new type, to use it you will need to construct a syntax tree directly 
(or extend the parser) */

/*
Plan:
1. Define new concrete type minimumVal as a struct with a field value Expr(?)
2. Make it satisfy the Expr interface by defining Eval() and Check() on it with appropriate logic
3. Extend Parser
